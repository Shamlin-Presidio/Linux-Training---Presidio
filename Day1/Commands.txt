1. Understand your Distribution:


  1. Found distribution name, version, and release information
	  /etc/os-release is a file (used cat to view)
	  lsb_release -a is a command that gives the same info, but concise 
  2. apt is used in ubuntu
     yum is used in redhat/centOS
  3. uname -r gave kernel version
  4. uptime gave how long the system has been running


2. Using man Pages:

  1. Used man man and found that section 5 of the man pages documents file formats and conventions.
  2.  -r, --reverse reverse order while sorting 
      Can be used with:
        -l → long listing
        -t → sort by modification time
        -S → sort by file size
 
  3.  installed man-db 
	    then ran man-k password which gave all commands that has “password” in its short description
	    chage is the command used to change password aging/expiry.

      ran
      man -K "password expiry" 
      This opened man for chage directly (-K checks full description and thus found the match)



3.The Shell and Its Modes:

  1. echo $SHELL gave: /bin/bash

  2.    echo "export EDITOR=vim" >> ~/.bashrc
	      source ~/.bashrc

  3. 	echo 'echo "Hello, Yogesh!"' > hello.sh
	    chmod +x hello.sh
	    ./hello.sh
	    
      gave: 
		    Hello, Yogesh!
	
	    I Used vim to change name to Shamlin

	    /hello.sh gave:
		  Hello, Shamlin!



4.Understanding the File System:

  1.  cat /proc/uptime 
  2.  cat /etc/hostname
  3.  ls /var/log
      contains all system and service logs, which could help to troubleshoot issues, track security related things etc
      Eg auth.log, syslog
  4. echo test > /dev/null 
	    —— this did nothing, just a black hole as described
  5. ls -l /proc/1234/cwd
	  gave:
		  lrwxrwxrwx 1 ubuntu ubuntu 0 Sep  1 08:51 /proc/2431/cwd -> /





5. System Capabilities:

  1.  cat /proc/cpuinfo
  2.  cat /proc/meminfo
  3.  ps -ef | wc -l 
  4. who
