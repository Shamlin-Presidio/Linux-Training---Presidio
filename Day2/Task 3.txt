TASK DESCRIPTION:
Two engineers (u1, u2) are collaborating in /srv/shared. They both need to write files,
but neither should be able to delete the otherâ€™s files.
1. Create users u1 and u2 in your system.
2. Set up /srv/shared so both users can create files.
3. Enforce that only file owners can delete their files.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I've learnt that we have to use sticky bits, which are commonly used in shared files


COMMANDS:
----------

sudo adduser u1
sudo adduser u2

sudo mkdir -p /srv/shared


sudo groupadd sharedgrp

sudo usermod -aG sharedgrp u1
sudo usermod -aG sharedgrp u2


sudo chown root:sharedgrp /srv/shared


this command took some time to understand:
Referred: https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/suid-sgid-sticky-bit
--------------------------------------------
sudo chmod 3770 /srv/shared


then I tried loggin to u1 create a file, then switch to u2 and delete the file
The permission to delete the file was not there, as expected.
