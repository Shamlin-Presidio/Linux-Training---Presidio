TASK DESCRIPTION :
------------------

Youâ€™re working on a cloud-hosted VM and you find that your team is using a
password to gain sudo access. Your goal is to allow users to elevate privileges with
sudo without the root password and run any command. Ensure you only allow login
via SSH only with a private key for that user


COMMANDS:
---------

Firstly, we have to edit the sudoers file

sudo vim /etc/sudoers
the first line I read there was :

# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.

so I ran :
sudo visudo


Then I set:
%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL


-----------

SSH Only login:

sudo vim sshd_config

I set :
PasswordAuthentication no
