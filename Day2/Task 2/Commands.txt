I ran a sleep command
it gave me a process id



TO check high CPU consuming processes I ran:
----------------------------------------------------

ps -eo pid,%cpu
which gave me 0.0 as CPU consumption values, so now I had to sort them:

ps -eo pid,%cpu --sort=-%cpu 
this gave me a lot of processes

so I ran 
ps -eo pid,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head
----------------------------------------------------

then I killed the sleep process

kill 15805

(sleep is not consuming much cpu)
